    <p> Cricket is my favourite sport and also my hobby. When I grow up I will become a cricketer. I am a right arm fast bowler. I also bat but I prefer bowling. I love playing cricket. My favourite cricketer is Virat Kohli. I am also inspired by him. I am 10 years old and I am in the 5th. I also went for cricket coaching but because of corona virus the class got closed. My father also plays cricket and he is a wicket keeper. I am inspired by him alot.
